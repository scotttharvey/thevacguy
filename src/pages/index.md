        Creating a clean and healthy home environment for your family is
        important.  Many people take their home’s air for granted and assume it
        is safe, clean and breathable. The problem is, indoor air can be up to
        100 times more polluted than outdoor air! Several reasons for this
        increase include today’s more tightly sealed housing construction,
        synthetic building materials and furnishings, and chemically formulated
        household products.

        The CENTRAL VACUUM SYSTEM is the most powerful and convenient way to
        keep you home looking and feeling clean. Everything about the system is
        designed for performance from consistent suction power to the
        comfortable easy to operate hose handle. This is cleaning at its very
        best.   


        Leading organizations are talking about how central vacuum systems
        improve Indoor Air Quality (IAQ):


        "Using central vacuum systems that are vented outside the living space
        can significantly reduce dust mites, pollens, animal dander and other
        allergy causing agents." - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency


        <strong>

        "Central vacuum systems are among the best indoor air quality
        investments for your home." – BUILDER Magazine

        </strong>


        "Allergy sufferers’ symptoms can be improved up to 61% when using a
        central vacuum system." – University of California Davis School of
        Medicine


        "The healthiest type of vacuum to operate is a central vacuum that is
        vented outdoors."


        – The Healthy Home Institute

      "It is rare in the high-priced/quick sale world that we find someone who
      not only loves what they do - they love what they sell.  Jim was
      EXCEPTIONAL in every sense of the word when selling and installing our
      central vac.  He carefully answered all of the ridiculous questions I had,
      came over to my home 3 times to make sure everything was perfect,
      presented multiple products for purchase and then carefully explained the
      merits of each.  Without hesitation, I would recommend THEVACGUY to ANYONE
      and EVERYONE.  I am not only thrilled with our investment, I feel
      fortunate to have worked with Jim."
